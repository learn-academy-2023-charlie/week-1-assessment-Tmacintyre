# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: Provided by instructor in class.

Researched answer: Provided by instructor in class.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a software that is used to keep track of the code you are working on. Github is basically like the cloud which allows you to store your code in a cloud based server. Github uses the git technology.

Researched answer: Git is a version control system that allows a user to manage and track their code, while github is a cloud based server that you can use to backup your files in its repositories allowing you to store your code off your local computer. It also allows you to collaborate your code with other users you are working with to share and edit code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The logical operators of && and || return a Boolean value which would result in a True or False.

Researched answer: It appears there are 4 operators that will return a Boolean value: &&, ||, !(NOT), and ??. These operators can be used together to prove something True or False.

1. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays index is like a placeholder in which a value is stored. The arrays value is the stored data within its indexes.

Researched answer: The value is stored within an arrays index. The index is the specific location for which a value is stored in an array.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Arrays are a way to store multiple pieces of data into one variable. Strings are a specific data type that can be stored within an array. So basically the main difference array can hold a collection of data types while strings only store text. The main similarity is that both are a collection of data.

Researched answer: An array is a special type of variable that stores a collection of type-like data while a string is a set of characters represented as a single type of data. Both a string and an array are set up differently while a string is shown as (") and an array setup using []. A major difference between the two is that an array can be altered while a string cannot be altered.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Proper pair programming involves two rolls, the navigator and the driver. The role of the driver is to share their screen and participate hands on as the coder. The navigator is hands off meaning no hard coding, however, they instruct the driver on what to type in as the code. The navigator instructs the driver on what to do. The two then set a limit on when to switch roles so that both users get to have adaquate time in each role providing practice for both.

Researched answer: Pair programming is an Agile software development technique involving two programmers working together to produce code on one workstation. This enables the ability to share information and knowledge between the programmers. The two roles include the driver who is typing the code as well as the navigator who is activley reviewing each line to code 
and providing guidance to the driver.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher order functions can use other functions in the parameters and can return a new function.

2. Jest: Jest is a testing method to ensure your JS code is correct, and allows debugging.

3. Objects: An object is standalone that includes properties and type. The properties held by an object define its characteristics. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

4. Method: Methods are similiar to a function as they both are a set of instructions, however methods are associated with objects while functions are not. A method IS a function and is a property of an object.

5. Classes: A class is a certain type of function that is used as a template to store information.
